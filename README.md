Inspiration

Tired of 2D photos for visualization and decision making
What it does

Stitches 2D photos of an object into 3D model which employed into a interactive augmented reality for critical visualization and decision making between users at remote area
How we built it

We build client mobile iOS app in Swift and for interactive augmented models we used RealityKit and ARKit The 2D to 3D modelling was done through metal graphical Api apple. Goolge Cloud Platform and python server are used for interaction between mobile client and server for image and file transfer
Challenges we ran into

Running Graphics Intensive Computation of 2D images into 3D models, and creating Interactive Augmented 3d objects
Accomplishments that we're proud of
What we learned
What's next for RealAR

Real time Interaction between two end users
